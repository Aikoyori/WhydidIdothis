# Why did I do this? Mod for Dicey Dungeons
Dicey Dungeons mod for people who is bad at game like me. Basically set every loot to one of the 4 items.

# Why?
I suck at the game. It is also not that OP since you have to use fighter's original weapon to progress to the first chest. <br><br>
I know there are cheats for this game but that's just too easy and does not offer any challenge. 

# The items!
![These equipments are super OP](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/424216831771934733/626827507869417483/unknown.png)

### 0. How to get these items

They are found everywhere including chests and shops. It should work with any episode. I tested it and it worked so yeah if any episode didn't work let me know by creating an issue here.

### 1. Impending Doom
Completely destroy the opponent with this nuke portrayed as a fucking Dicey Dungeons equipment. Deals damage of all types equals to the dice.

### 2. Gamma Curse
Inflicts opponent with every possible status effect of 20 except poison. Rendering them completely harmless for one turn.

### 3. Infinidicer
As the name implies, this creates all dices from 1 through 6 and also returns the dice.

### 4. Thorn Bloom
Commits paasiveness by inflicting opponent with poison equals to dice number and also confuses them. Additionally, the player is also inflicted with Thorns 5.

### Quick note
If you get one of these items can't possibly fucking lose the game. It is fun to mess around with the game so I gave it a try the this happened.<br>
Note that all of these items are reusable and immune to errors.

Except this :<br>

# Now how do I install it?
Easy!

Download the entire thing as ZIP (or git clone if you want to).<br>

Then **EXTRACT** WhydidIdothis-master into Dicey Dungeons' mod folder. <br>

Then either use in-game modselector or use `mod=WhydidIdothis` launch option.
